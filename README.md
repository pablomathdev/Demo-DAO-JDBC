### The Data Access Object (DAO)
This is a design pattern used in Java to separate the business logic and the data access logic in an application. It provides a layer of abstraction between the application and the data source, such as a database, a file system, or an external web service.

The DAO pattern involves defining a set of **interfaces** and classes that encapsulate the data access logic. The interfaces define the contract between the application and the DAO layer, while the classes implement the interfaces and provide the actual implementation of the data access operations.
